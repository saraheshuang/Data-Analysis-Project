##Project Introduction

This project cleans and explores the Open Street Map (OSM) data at the San-Jose metro area where I currently live. I am focused on understanding the quality of open street map data from the point of view as an urban planner and transportation researcher. I examined the data quality from a transportation professional and urban planner point of view and am focused on street activities (residence and amenities), street system, the bicycle network and the public transportation system . I cleaned some of the data in python and transformed them into json. I also shared results of my exploration on the fixed json data in MongoDB.

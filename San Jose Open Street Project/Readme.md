##Cleaning and Exploring the Open Street Data for San-Jose Metro Area

This project cleans and explores the Open Street Map (OSM) data at the San-Jose metro area where I currently live. It examines the data quality from an urban planner's point of view by focusing on five areas: street activities (residence and amenities), street system, the bicycle network and the public transportation system. I found the address data in most neighborhoods are quite incomplete, while the street dataset are mostly complete, there are inaccurate tags requires further cleaning. In terms of bicycle system, though the data contains some inconsistency and inaccuracy issues, open street map in general has quite a rich dataset on cycle infastructure. However, public transportation data at OSM is widely incompleted at San Jose Area. 

 I cleaned some of the data in python and transformed them into json. I also shared results of my exploration on the fixed json data in MongoDB.

## Dognition Project: How to increase the number of tests completed by users?

Background: [dognition](https://www.dognition.com/) is a webiste that helps people understand the character of their dogs through games and tests. The website provides users a handful of well-designed dog games/tests and ask the users to record their dogs' performance. Based on the collective datasets on the various types of dogs, doginition generates report and statistics on their dogs and dogs in general. The project explore the ways about how to increase the number of tests/games on dogs based on doginition sql dataset. This database includes six tables: users, dogs, reviews, complete_tests, site_activities, and exam_answers with over 2.5 million rows in total. The two files documents how I executed sql query to explore possible factors based on the instruction provided.

Note: The project is a course project called Managing the Big Data with Mysql at Coursera.

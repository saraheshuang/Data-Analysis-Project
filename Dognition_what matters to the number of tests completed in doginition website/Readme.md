## Dognition Project: How to increase the number of tests completed by users?

**Background**: 
  [dognition](https://www.dognition.com/) is a webiste that helps people understand the character of their dogs through games and tests. The website provides users a handful of well-designed dog games/tests and ask the users to record their dogs' performance. Based on the collective datasets on the various types of dogs, doginition generates report and statistics on their dogs and dogs in general. 

**Project summary and data description**:
  The project explore the ways about how to increase the number of tests/games on dogs based on doginition sql dataset. This database includes six tables: users, dogs, reviews, complete_tests, site_activities, and exam_answers with over 2.5 million rows in total. 
  
  This and this Markdown file documents how I executed sql queries to explore possible factors of dog characteristic and test circumstances. I also developed a data story board using tableau to communicate the results.

  Note: This is a course project on "Managing the Big Data with Mysql" and "Data Visualization and Communication with Tableau" at Coursera.

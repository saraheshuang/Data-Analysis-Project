#Finding Factors that are related to Survival at Titanic



What are key factors that are related to people's survival at Tatinic? Were women more likely to survive? Were the wealthy more likely to survive? Did they give the youth more chance to get on the rescue boats? The project looked into the popular [Titanic passenger dataset online](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It documents my exploratory analysis, my assumption and statistic testing using python. We found out Gender, Class and whether to be younger than 16 are the three key factors to survival.

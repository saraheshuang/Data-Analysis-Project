#The Green Card Timeline For Chinese EB1 Applicants

Data wrangling, R, Tableau, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization


The immigration road for foreign workers, especially the Chinese workers is usually thorny, even for the very best of them. So how fast could the first preference EB-1 worker of Chinese nationality receive the green cards after the change of the status form (I485 form) are filed?  In theory, there is no waiting time for this approval. But in reality, it might be up to one year. So what is the average time? What are the factors affecting the timeline, the approval center, the application type or the timing of application? 

This project uses the largest voluntary EB1 timeline dataset from the largest online oversea Chinese forum the "Mitbbs". The dataset collected the timeline of 526 Chinese EB1 applicants filed between Jan 13, 2013 to September 2, 2015. I cleaned the  datasets in R and visualized the data in tableau. We found time (Year) is the most influential factors to the EB1 application. The applied center and the type under EB1 does not make much difference. The tableau dashboard visualizes these factors. It also documents the timeline of hundreds of hard-working and outstanding Chineseâ€™ status change from non-immigrant workers to immigrants.
